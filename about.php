        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>In the heart of Mogpog, Marinduque, Philippines, lies "Sarang-jin Keopi Hub," a café born from love. It wasn't always a business.
             For years, Lolo and Lola lived in a humble bahay kubo. Our grandparents make us coffee every morning, and to honor them, we
              founded this coffee shop and named it Sarang-jin Keopi Hub.</p>
        
        <p>Sarang-jin Keopi Hub" isn't just a café; it's a testament that the greatest inheritance is love. In this little corner of
             Marinduque, every sip tells a story of family, culture, and the happiness found in a perfectly brewed, love-infused cup of coffee.</p>
